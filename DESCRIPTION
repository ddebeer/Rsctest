Description: This R-package includes two approaches to perform a score-test for
    DIF detection based on resampling techniques, and is focused on data from 
    Multi-Stage Adaptive Tests. Currently the functionality is limited to the 
    1-, 2-, and 3-PL models. Only the DIF in the threshold (b) and 
    slope (a) parameter are tested for.
